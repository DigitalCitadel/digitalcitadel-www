# About

Hey!  I'm Brandon Romano, a web and mobile developer who loves building applications with great user experience.  I currently have a pretty heavy focus on Android development, but I'm actually quite the well-rounded developer.

I've recently been writing a bunch of `Go` and `Android`.  For fun, I've been testing the limits of `Bash`.  I work with a whole bunch more languages, but I'm not going to list them all out here.  Hopefully you'll be able to dig that out of the context of my posts.

I'm currently not available for any freelance work, although feel free to drop me a line: `brandon@digitalcitadel.com`.
